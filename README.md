# MUI Icons GPT

👋 Welcome to MUI Icons GPT! 🎉

MUI Icons GPT is a prototype React component that allows an AI to select the best icon to use based on the surrounding context of a website. 🤖

With MUI Icons GPT, you can save time and make your website more user-friendly by letting the AI do the heavy lifting of selecting icons. This innovative solution is made possible through the OpenAI Chat GPT API. 🌟

Please note that MUI Icons GPT is still a work in progress, but we're excited to share a demo of this feature in action on a live todo list app. 🔨

Our ultimate goal is to make it easy to install and configure the MUI Icons GPT component with an OpenAI key. We'll keep you updated on our progress and welcome any feedback or contributions to the project. 💬

🚀 Getting Started

To try out the demo of MUI Icons GPT, simply head to our live todo list app: [HERE](https://mui-icons-qo4b90fkq-jacksonet00.vercel.app/)

We've also included the source code for the demo in this repository so you can see how it works. 🤓
